# C172P-1982-Cockpit

The goal of this project is to construct parts for use in a Flight Simulation Cockpit.
I am an amateur and am fully open to different approaches to the kind of problems likely to surface in a project like this.  

## Current Drawings:

* Lower Panel (Prototype version)
* Left Side Instrument Panel (Prototype version)

OpenSCAD designs for gauges, instruments, radios, controls and cockpit structures are are needed:

* Suction Gauge
* Clock
* Fuel Gauges
* Oil Gauges
* AMPS Electrical Gauge
* Airspeed Indicator
* Turn Coordinator

## OpenSCAD 2d/3d Modeling software

Since I'm new to OpenSCAD, I intend to borrow code, coding rules, designs and techniques heavily from people who have developed substantial bodies of work using OpenSCAD.
I"m taking a close look at https://github.com/nophead/NopSCADlib for ideas about how to structure a large OpenSCAD project.

A list of OpenSCAD libraries in use in the project:
* threads.scad 
* spline.scad
