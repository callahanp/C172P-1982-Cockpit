I'm building a flight simulator cockpit, otherwise known as a "Sim Pit".

I'm determined to do it from scratch, with no bought parts.  This is little
like doing legos without instructions, and doing them before legos were invented.

My personal target is the 1982 version of the Cessna 172P, the primary aircraft in the 
Flightgear Flight Simulator program see http://flightgear.org.  Designs for other 
Aircraft and other Simulation programs are encouraged and can be made part of this project.


The project is in its beginning stages and has several fronts:

1. Interfacing with Flightgear and other Flight Simulation Software
2. Controller Hardware Interfaces and Protocols
3. Hardware Electronics for Motors, LEDs, Displays etc.
4. Electrical Connections and Power Distribution
5. Physical Cockpit Construction
   1. Individual Instruments, Gauges, Radios and Controls
   2. Instrument and Control Panels
   3. Cockpit Structure
   4. Motion and Feedback
   5. Video Scenery Display or Projection

OpenSCAD is used for the design.  Parts can be built by hand, 3d printed or milled.
